# Why a personal blog?
- Why not?
- Started blogging in May 2021
- Wanted to write about my GSoC Project
- I just hate Medium
- Topics of interest are random
- Blog about anything

---------

# Why Python? (Isn't it slow)
- There's `hugo`, `eleventy`, `jekyll`, yes
    - `hugo` supposed to be very fast
- *Python on my mind*
- Found [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican)
    - A Static Site Generator written in Python
- Speed not an issue
- Productivity is

---------

# My own mods to the default setup
- I have a custom theme `apricot` - made with some patches to an already existing theme
    - Dark mode 💯
    - Custom code blocks with a *Copý* button
    - My map of Talks
    - Custom, home-grown, 100% organic Pagination
